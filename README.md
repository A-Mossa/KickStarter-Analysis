# Kickstarting with Excel

## **Overview of Project**
This is an analysis of data on kickstarter campaigns  that took in consideration the time of launch, outcome and different categories to determine what would be the best strategy to launch a new funding campaign in different industries.

### Purpose
This analysis would help Louise who wants to start a funding campaign for her new play, make data-informed decisions to increase the chances of success for the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
The data itself was mostly clean and valid, all be it mixed and not completely relevant to the specific industry our client was involved in. however,  a portion of the data was sufficient for the analysis we carried out, and an accurate analysis has been reached.

some challenges that I anticipated was encountering incomplete or unclean data, missing and unclean data, and the timeline of project completion. fortunately, none of the above issues were encountered and hiccups were minor.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on month analysis launch date of kickstarter theater campaigns, some interesting findings appeared.
from thourough analysis of data provided we concluded:
-The months with the most launched campaigns are May, June, and July. 
-The highest number of successful campaigns were launched in Q2, and the months are May, June, and July respecectively.
-The months with highest failed campaigns are May, October, and August.

From the above findings we discovered that around mid year, is when most of the campaigns launch. May especially was the month that saw the most campaigns launched with a success rate of 66% followed by June then July.
May, June and July were recommended to the client to launch their campaign as it historically it shows the most success rate. August, October, and December are found to be the months with the hughest failure rate.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The campaign goal appeared to be a major factor in the success of a project. it had the following effect:
-Campaigns that saw the most success were the ones that had a goal of less than a 1000, 1000 to 4999, and 35000 to 49000.
-Campaigns with the least success were those with a goal of 45000 to 49999, 50000 or more, and 30000 to 34999.
